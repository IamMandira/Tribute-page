        <h2>Swami Vivekananda: A Hindu monk who conquered the world</h2>
        
            
                <p >Swami Vivekananda , also known as Narendranath Dutta, was a great social reformer and a very inspiring
                     personality of India.The Hindu monk and philosopher was a chief disciple of Sri Ramakrishna
                      Paramhansha Dev. Influenced by Western esotericism, he was a key figure in the introduction of the
                      Indian darsanas (teachings, practices) of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world,
                      and is credited with raising interfaith awareness, bringing Hinduism to the status of a major world 
                      religion during the late 19th century. He was a major force in the contemporary Hindu reform
                       movements in India, and contributed to the concept of nationalism in colonial India. Vivekananda
                        founded the Ramakrishna Math and the Ramakrishna Mission.He is perhaps best known for his speech 
                        which began with the words "Sisters and brothers of America ...,"
                     in which he introduced Hinduism at the Parliament of the World's Religions in Chicago in 1893.</p>
